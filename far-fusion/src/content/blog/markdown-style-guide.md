This is my **personal developer portfolio**, built using **React** and powered by **Vite** for a lightning-fast development experience. Designed and coded in **Visual Studio Code**, this project highlights my technical skills, project experience, and design senseâ€”all in a single-page format.

### ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Fully Responsive Design** â€“ works on mobile, tablet, and desktop  
- **Smooth Scroll Navigation**  
- **Project Showcase Section** linked to live demos and GitHub  
- **Contact Form** with email integration *(Planned)*  
- **Minimalist UI** with clean layout and focus on content

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- React  
- Vite  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- HTML5 & CSS3  
- Visual Studio Code  
- GitHub Pages *(for deployment)*

### ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy

The portfolio is designed with simplicity in mindâ€”clean fonts, minimal color palette, and just enough animation to keep it visually engaging without distracting from the content. Every section is intentionally structured to communicate professionalism and approachability.

### ðŸ“š What I Learned
