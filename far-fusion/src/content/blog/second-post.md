### ðŸ›  Tech Stack 
- Java
- Swing
- Apache NetBeans
- FlatLaf
- Gson

The Task Manager is a robust desktop application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. Built using Java Swing in Apache NetBeans, the app combines functionality with a modern UI experience using the FlatLaf look and feel. It allows users to add, edit, complete, and delete tasks while maintaining data persistence using Gson for local JSON-based storage.

### âœ¨ Key Features

- Intuitive UI with FlatLaf for a sleek, modern desktop experience
- Add tasks with title, description, priority, and due date
- Task status tracking: Pending vs. Completed
- Edit and delete existing tasks
- Persistent data storage using Gson (JSON file-based)
- Tabbed interface for easy navigation between pending and completed tasks
- Search, sort, and filter tasks for better task organization

### ðŸ’¡ Personal Reflection

This project highlights my strengths in desktop application development, Java Swing UI design, state management, and integrating lightweight persistence solutions without databases.
